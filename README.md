# QuEST: Stable Training of LLMs with 1-Bit Weights and Activations

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1234.56789-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05003)

## Quickstart 

Create a conda environment and install dependencies (we recommend Python 3.10):

```bash
conda create -n env python=3.10
conda activate env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a simple training on the SlimPajama 6B dataset:
```bash
python ./src/main.py
```

The above command trains a 213.34M parameters model with the Llama-style architecture. We recommend to use the `--compile` flag that speeds up training noticeably (up to 20% in our setup).

## Abstract

One approach to reducing the massive costs of large language models (LLMs) is the use of quantized or sparse representations for training or deployment. While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, a recent study ([arXiv:2411.04330v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04330v2)) put the "optimal" bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracy-competitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations.

We advance this state-of-the-art via a new method called QuEST, which is Pareto-competitive with FP16, i.e., it provides better accuracy at lower model size, while training models with weights and activations in 4-bits or less. Moreover, QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST). 

## Quantization

See `train.sh` for an example on how to run quantized training.

## INT4 Inference Kernels

We provide Triton/CUDA kernels for INT4 Inference on NVIDIA Ampere GPUs. The code is particularly optimized for RTX 4090.

**[Work in Progress]** The floating point numbers are currently hardcoded to type float16 in the matrix multiplication and dequantization CUTLASS template. We are adapting it to type bfloat16. However, the difference in the data types should not affect the speedup benchmarks.

### Install

#### Dependencies

- cmake
- C++ compiler (GCC/clang/...)
- nvcc

#### Instructions

```bash
cd gemm-quest
pip install -e .
```

### Benchmark

After installation, please copy the Python scripts in the `gemm-quest/quest` folder to the `src` folder in our main QuEST project folder.

You can then run the layerwise and end-to-end benchmarks using these scripts. You may need to adjust some configurations in the files to adapt your machine.
